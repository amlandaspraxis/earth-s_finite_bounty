            Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15 or Global Goal 15) is about "Life on land". One of the 17
            Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015, the official wording is: "Protect,
            restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat
            desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss".[1] The Goal has 12
            targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards targets will be measured by 14 indicators.

            The nine outcome targets include: Conserve and restore terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; end
            deforestation and restore degraded forests; end desertification and restore degraded land; ensure
            conservation of mountain ecosystems, protect biodiversity and natural habitats; protect access to genetic
            resources and fair sharing of the benefits; eliminate poaching and trafficking of protected species; prevent
            invasive alien species on land and in water ecosystems; and integrate ecosystem and biodiversity in
            governmental planning. The three means of implementation targets[2] include: Increase financial resources to
            conserve and sustainably use ecosystem and biodiversity; finance and incentivize sustainable forest
            management; combat global poaching and trafficking.

            An annual report is prepared by the Secretary-General of the United Nations evaluating the progress towards
            the Sustainable Development Goals.[3] It provides data on changes in forest areas, desertification,
            biodiversity loss and other parameters that are of relevance for SDG 15.

        <h1>Targets, indicators and progress</h1>
        <p>The UN has defined 12 Targets and 14 Indicators for SDG 15. Five of them are to be achieved by the year 2020,
            two by the year 2030 and the rest have no target year.

            Each of the targets also has one or more indicators to measure progress. In total there are fourteen
            indicators for SDG 15. FAO is the custodian agency for three of the indicators for SDG targets 15.1, 15.2
            and 15.4.</p>
        <div class="target-title">
            <h3>Target 15.1: Conserve and restore terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.1 is: "By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of
                terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands,
                mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements."[

                This target has two indicators:

                <br>Indicator 15.1.1: Forest area as a proportion of the total land area
                <br>Indicator 15.1.2: Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are
                covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type
                <br>Forests cover roughly 4 billion hectares or 30.7 per cent of the world's land area. 93 percent are
                natural forests and 7 percent are planted. The forest area is defined by the land under natural or
                planted groups of trees of at least 5 meters in situ. The trees can be either be productive or
                non-productive and should not include fruit plantations and agroforestry systems and trees in urban
                parks and gardens. Protected areas are defined by three indicators: <br>1) the proportion of total
                terrestrial area classified as protected <br>2) the proportion of important sites of terrestrial
                biodiversity who are protected <br>3) and proportion of important sites of freshwater biodiversity that
                are
                protected.

                The United Nations General Assembly has defined Sustainable forest management as a dynamic and evolving
                concept that aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of
                forests, for the benefit of present and future generations (Resolution A/RES/62/98).[4] It aims to find
                a balance between the increasing demands for forest products and the benefits as well as preserving the
                health and diversity of the forests.

                SDG indicator 15 is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of
                sustainable forest management. They provide qualification to the management of forest areas and assess
                areas with a set on national and international standards.
            </p>
            <h3>Target 15.3: End desertification and restore degraded land</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.3 is: "By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil,
                including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land
                degradation-neutral world."

                This target has one indicator: <br>'Indicator 15.3.1 is the "Proportion of land that is degraded over
                the
                total land area".

                Desertification affects as much as one-sixth of the world's population, 70% of all drylands, and
                one-quarter of the total land area of the world. It also leads to spreading poverty and the degradation
                of billion hectares of cropland.</p>
            <h3>Target 15.4: Ensure conservation of mountain ecosystems</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.4 is: "By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including
                their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for
                sustainable development."

                This target has two indicators: <br>

                Indicator 15.4.1: Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity <br>
                Indicator 15.4.2: Mountain Green Cover Index <br>
                The Mountain Green Cover Index measured the percentage of mountain environments covered by green areas
                and the capacity of those areas to fulfil their ecosystem roles.

                As of 2017, 76% of the world's mountain areas were covered by green vegetation, including forests,
                shrubs, grassland and cropland.[9] The Mountain Green Cover was lowest in Western Asia and Northern
                Africa (60%) and highest in Oceania (96%).</p>
            <h3>Target 15.5: Protect biodiversity and natural habitats</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.5 is: "Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of
                natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of
                threatened species."

                This target has one indicator: Indicator 15.5.1 is the "Red List Index".

                A report in 2018 stated that "biodiversity must be mainstreamed across these sectors and spatial
                planning integrated accordingly."</p>
            <h3>Target 15.6: Protect access to genetic resources and fair sharing of the benefits</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.6 is: "Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the
                utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally
                agreed."

                This target has one indicator: Indicator 15.6.1 is the "Number of countries that have adopted
                legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits".
                This indicator is used to track countries' participation in protocols related to the promotion and
                sharing of genetic resources for plants, food and agriculture.
            </p>
            <h3>Target 15.7: Eliminate poaching and trafficking of protected species</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.7 is: "Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected
                species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products."

                This target has one Indicator: <br> Indicator 15.7.1 is the "Proportion of traded wildlife that was
                poached
                or illicitly trafficked".

                In general, wildlife trade policies that incentivize sustainable use typically have more immediate
                positive effects on wildlife populations than outright trade bans.

                No data is available for this indicator yet.</p>
            <h3>Target 15.8: Prevent invasive alien species on land and in water ecosystems</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.8 is: "By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and
                significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or
                eradicate the priority species."

                This target has one Indicator: <br> Indicator is 15.8.1 is the "Proportion of countries adopting
                relevant
                national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species".

                Wildlife poaching and trafficking threaten biodiversity and ecosystems as well as local livelihoods,
                wellbeing and security. Trafficking is normally driven by organized crime, and made easy by corruption
                and weak governance.</p>
            <h3>Target 15.9: Integrate ecosystem and biodiversity in governmental planning</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.9 is: "By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and
                local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts."

                Indicator is 15.9.1 is the "Progress towards national targets established in accordance with Aichi
                Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020".

                "Aichi Biodiversity Target 2" addresses the underlying causes of biodiversity loss.
            </p>
            <h3>Target 15.a: Increase financial resources to conserve and sustainably use ecosystem and biodiversity
            </h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.a is: "Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all
                sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems."

                This target has one Indicator: Indicator 15.a.1 is the "Official development assistance and public
                expenditure on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems".
            </p>
            <h3>Target 15.b: Finance and incentivize sustainable forest management</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.b is: "Mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to
                finance sustainable forest management and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance
                such management, including for conservation and reforestation."

                This target has one indicator: <br>Indicator 15.b.1 is the "Official development assistance and public
                expenditure on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems".

                This target aims at mobilizing resources at all levels to finance sustainable forest management. The
                United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030 (UNSPF) presents a global framework for actions at
                all levels to sustainably manage forests and halt deforestation and forest degradation.
            </p>
            <h3>Target 15.c: Combat global poaching and trafficking</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 15.c is: "Enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking
                of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable
                livelihood opportunities."

                This target has one indicator: Indicator 15.c.1 is the "Proportion of traded wildlife that was poached
                or illicitly trafficked".

                The illegal trade and animal trafficking have grown significantly to become one of the world's largest
                black markets valued at tens of billions of dollars. The challenges to combat global poaching and
                trafficking need to be addressed by enforcing laws and strengthening institutions.</p>
            <h3>Custodian agencies</h3>
            <p>The custodian agencies are responsible for data gathering and reporting on the indicators. They are:

                <br>Indicator 15.1.1, 15.2.1 and 15.4.2: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
                <br>Indicator 15.1.2: United Nations Environmental Programme-World Conservation Monitoring Center

        <h1>Monitoring and progress</h1>
        <p>An annual report is prepared by the Secretary-General of the United Nations evaluating the progress towards
            the Sustainable Development Goals.[3] According to the expert group meeting in preparation for the
            High-level Political Forum of 2018, SDG 15 needs more indicators in areas such as forest intactness,
            management effectiveness of protected areas, and meaningful integration of biodiversity into other
            processes.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="sdgs15">
        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>As of 2023, there is approximately a $700 billion gap in financial support to help low-income countries
            protect biodiversity.</p>
        <h3>Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
        <p>In 2020, there was brief progress on SDGs 12 to 15 on sustainable production and consumption, climate action
            and biodiversity conservation, but these gains were quickly offset once restrictions were lifted. This
            applies to CO₂ emissions, which declined in major economies during lockdowns, but went quickly back to their
            pre-pandamic levels after restrictions were lifted. It is estimated that deforestation increased by 12% from
            2019 to 2020, and plastic consumption and waste may also increase during pandemic.</p>

        <h3>Forest cover</h3>
        <p>Indicator 15.1.1 is “forest area as a proportion of total land area” in the UN SDG framework.

          <br>  Forest area is land under natural or planted stands of trees of at least 5 meters in situ, whether productive or not, and excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems (for example, in fruit plantations and agroforestry systems) and trees in urban parks and gardens.
            
           <br> Target: “By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services.”1
            
          <br>  Unlike most SDGs which have a target year of 2030, this indicator was set to be achieved by 2020.</p>

    <h3>Protection of important biodiversity areas</h3>
    <p>Indicator 15.1.2 is the “proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type” in the UN SDG framework.

     <br>   Protected areas are covered by three indicators: the proportion of total terrestrial area classified as protected; proportion of key terrestrial biodiversity areas that are protected; and proportion key freshwater biodiversity areas that are protected.

        <h3>Sustainable forest management</h3>
        <p>Indicator 15.2.1 is “progress towards sustainable forest management” in the UN SDG framework.

         <br>   Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of sustainable forest management.
            
         <br>   Three sub-indicators focus on the expansion of forest area, above-ground biomass within the forest area and the protection of forest biodiversity. The fourth relates to the availability of a long-term forest management plan; and the final indicator measures areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards.
            
          <br>  Target: “By 2020 promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally.”</p>

        <h1>End desertification and restore degraded land</h1>
        <h3>End land degradation</h3>
        <p>Indicator 15.3.1 is the “proportion of land that is degraded over total land area” in the UN SDG framework.

         <br>   This indicator is assessed using three sub-indicators:
            
         <br>   i) Trends in land cover: An example of land degradation due to land cover change is the conversion of forests into croplands or settlements.
            
          <br>  ii) Trends in land productivity: Land productivity is measured in terms of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of vegetation. Land is considered degraded in terms of productivity if its NPP is less than half the value of the 90th percentile NPP in the same region.
            
          <br>  iii) Carbon stock: This is considered degraded if there is a net reduction of 10% or more in soil organic carbon between the baseline and current observations.
            
          <br>  If any of the sub-indicators is deemed degraded for a specific land unit, it will be classified as degraded, pending validation by national authorities.
            
          <br>  Target: “By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world.”</p>

        <p>Indicator 15.4.1 is “coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity” in the UN SDG framework.
<br>
            This indicator measures the average share of each important site for mountain biodiversity that is covered by designated protected areas. The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which depends on a range of management and enforcement factors.
       <br>     
            Target: “By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.”</p>

        <h3>Vegetation coverage of mountainous areas</h3>
        <p>Indicator 15.4.2 is the “(a) Mountain Green Cover Index and (b) proportion of degraded mountain land” in the UN SDG framework.

          <br>  The Mountain Green Cover Index measures the percentage of mountainous areas covered by some form of green vegetation.
            
           <br> The Index measures the changes of the green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, crop land, etc. – in order to monitor progress on the mountain target. This is monitored through high resolution satellite imagery.
            
           <br> Target: “By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.”</p>

        <h1>Protect biodiversity and natural habitats</h1>
        <h3>Species extinction risk</h3>
        <p>Indicator 15.5.1 is the “Red List Index” in the UN SDG framework.

           <br> The Red List Index (RLI) shows the trends in overall extinction risk for groups of species. An RLI value of 1.0 equates to all species in the group being categorised as 'Least Concern', and hence that none are expected to go extinct in the near future. A value of 0 indicates that all species have gone extinct.
            
          <br>  Target: “Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.”</p>

        <h3>Prevent invasive alien species</h3>
        <p>Indicator 15.8.1 is the “proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species” in the UN SDG framework.

        <br>    Alien species are those which have been introduced outside their natural distribution range through either intentional or accidental dispersion by human activity.
            
         <br>   Invasive alien species impact native biodiversity thorugh competition for resources, predation, hybridisation, disease transmission, parasitism, herbivory and trampling and rooting. The outcomes of these impacts lead to biodiversity loss, habitat degradation, and loss of ecosystem services.
            
         <br>   Data for this indicator is shown in the interactive visualization.
            
          <br>  Target: “By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.”</p>
