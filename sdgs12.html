        <p>Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12 or Global Goal 12), titled "responsible consumption and production",
            is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official
            wording of SDG 12 is "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns". SDG 12 is meant to ensure
            good use of resources, improve energy efficiency and sustainable infrastructure, provide access to basic
            services, create green and decent jobs, and ensure a better quality of life for all. SDG 12 has 11
            targets to be achieved by at least 2030, and progress towards the targets is measured using 13 indicators.
            Sustainable Development Goal 12 has 11 targets. The first 8 are outcome targets, which are: implement the
            10‑Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns; achieve the sustainable
            management and efficient use of natural resources; reducing by half the per capita global food waste at the
            retail and consumer levels and the reduction of food losses along production and supply chains, including
            post-harvest losses; achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout
            their life cycle; reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse; encourage
            companies to adopt sustainable practices; promote public procurement practices that are sustainable; and
            ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development. The
            three means of implementation targets are: support developing countries to strengthen their scientific
            and technological capacity; develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts; and
            remove market distortions, like fossil fuel subsidies, that encourage wasteful consumption.

            Countries are working towards the implementation of the "10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable
            Consumption and Production Patterns".

            To ensure that plastic products are more sustainable, thus reducing plastic waste, changes such as
            decreasing usage and increasing the circularity of the plastic economy are expected to be required. An
            increase in domestic recycling and a reduced reliance on the global plastic waste trade are other actions
            that might help meet the goal.

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>Changes in consumption and production patterns can help to promote the decoupling of economic growth and
            human well-being from resource use and environmental impact. They can also trigger the transformations
            envisaged in global commitments on biodiversity, the climate, and sustainable development in general.

        <h1>Targets, indicators and progress</h1>
        <p>TSDG 12 has 11 targets. Four of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020, and six have
            no target years. The targets address different issues ranging from implementing the 10‑Year Framework of
            Programmes on: <br>
             Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (Target 12.1), 
             <br>Achieving the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources (Target 12.2), 
             <br>Having per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels (Target 12.3),

            all wastes throughout their life cycle (Target 12.4), 
            <br>Substantially reduce waste generation through
            prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (Target 12.5), 
            <br>Encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices
            (Target 12.6), 
            <br>Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national
            policies and priorities (Target 12.7), 
            <br>Ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and
            awareness for sustainable development (12.8), 
            <br>Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific
            and technological capabilities (Target 12.a), 
            <br>Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development
            impacts for sustainable grouwth (Target 12.b), 
            <br>Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage
            wasteful consumption by removing market distortions (Target 12.c).

        </p>
        <div class="target-title">
            <h3>Target 12.1: Implement the 10-year sustainable consumption and production framework</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 12.1 is: “Implement the 10‑Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable
                Consumption and Production Patterns, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the
                lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries". The goal of this
                SDG is to have all countries taking the action by 2030.

                It has one indicator: Indicator 12.1.1 is the "Number of countries with sustainable consumption and
                production (SCP) national action plans or SCP mainstreamed as a priority or a target into national
                policies".

                Many countries are working towards the implementation of the "10-Year Framework of Programmes on
                Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns".
            </p>
            <h3>Target 12.2: Sustainable management and use of natural resources</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 12.2 is: "By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of
                natural resources."

                This target has two indicators:
<br>
                Indicator 12.2.1: Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP <br>
                Indicator 12.2.2: Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic
                material consumption per GDP
                Material Footprint is the quantity of material extraction that is required to meet the consumption of a
                country. <br>The sum of material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metal ores is
                called the total material footprint. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a production-side measure
                which does not account for supply chain inputs or exports, meaning a country could have a lower DMC
                value, if it outsources a large proportion of its materials.

                A report by the UN in 2020 found that: "Global domestic material consumption per capita rose by 7 per
                cent, from 10.8 metric tons per capita in 2010 to 11.7 metric tons in 2017, with increases in all
                regions except Northern America and Africa."
            </p>
            <h3>arget 12.3: Halve global per capita food waste</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 12.3 is: "By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer
                levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses."
                This target has two components (losses and waste) measured by two indicators.
<br>
                Indicator 12.3.1.a: Food Loss Index which focuses on losses from production to consumption level <br>
                Indicator 12.3.1.b: Food Waste Index this indicator is a proposal under development <br>
                FAO and the United Nations Environment Programme measure progress towards this target.

                FAO found that "globally around 14 percent of the world’s food is lost from production before reaching
                the retail level".
            </p>
            <h3>Target 12.4: Responsible management of chemicals and waste</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 12.4 is: "By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and
                all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and
                significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on
                human health and the environment."

                This target has two indicators:
<br>
                Indicator 12.4.1: Number of parties to international multilateral environmental agreements on hazardous
                waste, and other chemicals that meet their commitments and obligations in transmitting information as
                required by each relevant agreement <br>
                Indicator 12.4.2: (a) Hazardous waste generated per capita; and (b) proportion of hazardous waste
                treated, by type of treatment <br>
                Global e-waste generation has grown during 2010 to 2019: from 5.3 kg per capita to 7.3 kg per
                capita. The "environmentally sound recycling of e-waste" also increased: from 0.8 kg per capita
                to 1.3 kg per capita.
            </p>
            <h3>Target 12.5: Substantially reduce waste generation</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 12.5 is: "By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention,
                reduction, recycling and reuse."

                It has one indicator: <br> Indicator 12.5.1 is the "National recycling rate, tons of material recycled".

                Every year, about one third of all food produce goes bad. This is worth about $1 trillion a year.
                The food spoils due to consumers, and goes bad during transportation.
            </p>
            <h3>Target 12.6: Encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices and sustainability reporting</h3>
            <p>Target 12.6: Encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices and sustainability reporting
            </p>
            <h3>TTarget 12.7: Promote sustainable public procurement practices</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 12.7 is: "Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in
                accordance with national policies and priorities."

                It has one indicator: <br>Indicator 12.7.1 is the "Degree of sustainable public procurement policies and
                action plan implementation". Three objectives, SPP, GPP and SRPP, all figure in the indicator:
<br>
                SPP: Sustainable public procurement <br>
                GPP: Green public procurement <br>
                SRPP: Socially responsible public procurement. <br>
                One of the limitations noted for this indicator is that different countries may implement and measure
                these objectives in different ways.
            </p>
            <h3>Target 12.8: Promote universal understanding of sustainable lifestyles</h3>
            <p>TThe full title of Target 12.8 is" By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information
                and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature."

                It has one indicator: <br>Indicator 12.8.1 is the "Extent to which <br>(i) global citizenship education and <br>(ii)
                education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in <br>(a) national education policies; <br>(b)
                curricula; <br>](c) teacher education; and <br>(d) student assessment".
            </p>
            <h3>Target 12.a: Support developing countries' scientific and technological capacity for sustainable
                consumption and production</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 12.A is: "Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and
                technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production."[1]

                It has one indicator: <br>Indicator 12.a.1 is the "Installed renewable energy-generating capacity in
                developing countries (in watts per capita)".</p>
            <h3>Target 12.b: Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable tourism</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 12.B is: "Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts
                for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products."

                It has one indicator: <br> Indicator 12.b.1 is the "Implementation of standard accounting tools to monitor
                the economic and environmental aspects of tourism sustainability".
            </p>
            <h3>Target 12.c: Remove market distortions that encourage wasteful consumption</h3>
            <p>The full title of Target 12.C is: "Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful
                consumption by removing market distortions in accordance with national circumstances, including
                restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies where they exist, to reflect their
                environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing
                countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the
                poor and the affected communities."

                It has one indicator: Indicator 12.c.1 is the: <br> "(a) Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies as a percentage of
                GDP; and <br>(b) amount of fossil fuel subsidies as a proportion of the total national expenditure on fossil
                fuels".

                Global fossil fuel subsidies in 2018 were $400 billion. This was double the subsidies for
                renewable energy.
            </p>

        <h3>Sustainable consumption and production action plans</h3>
        <p>ndicator 12.1.1 is the “number of countries developing, adopting, or implementing policy instruments aimed at supporting the shift to sustainable consumption and production” in the UN SDG framework.

           <br> The UN defines sustainable production and consumption as: “the use of services and related products, which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimising the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardise the needs of future generation.”

        <h1>Sustainable management and use of natural resources</h1>
        <h3>Material footprint</h3>
        <p>Indicator 12.2.1 is “material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP” in the UN SDG framework.

           <br> Material Footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material extraction to domestic final demand of a country. The total material footprint is the sum of the weight of the used biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metal ores.
            
          <br>  It is measured on the basis of consumption, which means that it is a country’s domestic material footprint adjusted for trade.
            
          <br>  Data on this indicator for material footprint per capita and per unit of GDP is shown in the interactive visualizations. This is currently only available as global estimates.

            <br>   Domestic Material Consumption measures the total amount of material directly used in an economy. It measures material production, rather than consumption because it is not adjusted for trade.
            
            <br> “Materials” include biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic minerals.

        <h1>Halve global per capita food waste</h1>
        <h3>Global food loss</h3>
        <p>Indicator 12.3.1 is the “(a) global food loss index and (b) food waste index” in the UN SDG framework.

            <br>  The ‘Food Loss Index’ measures how losses in the food supply chain have changed relative to 2015.
            
            <br>  Food ‘losses’ are defined as the loss or wastage of food from the farm up to the retail level. Pre-harvest losses, and retail and consumer waste are not included.
            
            <br> Data for this metric is shown in the interactive visualization.
            
            <br>  Target: By 2030 “halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.”</p>

        <h1>Remove market distortions that encourage wasteful consumption</h1>
        <h3>Removing fossil fuel subsidies</h3>
        <p> Indicator 12.c.1 is the “Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies (production and consumption) per unit of GDP” in the UN SDG framework.
            <br>  
            This includes pre-tax subsidies for both production and consumption of fossil fuels, as a share of total gross domestic product. Production subsidies reduce the cost of producing coal, oil or gas. Consumption subsidies cut fuel prices for the end user, such as by fixing the price at the petrol pump so that it is less than the market rate.
            <br>  
            Data for this indicator is shown in the interactive visualization.
            <br>  
            Target: By 2030 “rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities.”</p>
