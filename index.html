        <h1>Sustainable Development Goals</h1>
        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations
            in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people
            enjoy peace and prosperity.
            The 17 SDGs are integrated—they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that
            development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
            Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to
            end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.
            The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the
            SDGs in every context.
