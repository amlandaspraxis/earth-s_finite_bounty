        <h1>Abstract:</h1>
        <p>This report examines the limitations of Earth's resources and explores the challenges associated with
            managing them effectively. With a focus on sustainable resource management, the report discusses the
            consequences of resource depletion and overexploitation, as well as the need for equitable resource
            distribution. It also highlights the importance of policy, technological innovations, public awareness, and
            engagement in addressing these challenges.</p>
        <h2>Limited Resources:</h2>
        <p>Discusses the finite nature of Earth's resources, including minerals, water, land, and energy
            sources.<br><br>Highlights the growing demand for resources due to population growth and industrial
            development.</p>
        <h2>Consequences of Overexploitation:</h2>
        <p>Examines the environmental and ecological impacts of overexploitation, such as deforestation, overfishing,
            and excessive mining.<br><br>Addresses the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems as a
            result of unsustainable practices.</p>
        <h2>Resource Depletion:</h2>
        <p>Explores the concept of non-renewable resources and their eventual exhaustion. <br><br>Emphasizes the need
            for alternative energy sources and the adoption of efficient technologies to reduce reliance on finite
            resources.</p>
        <h2>Equitable Resource Distribution:</h2>
        <p>Discusses the disparities in resource availability and the resulting inequalities in access and wealth
            distribution.<br><br>Highlights the importance of addressing these disparities for achieving social and
            economic justice.</p>
        <h2>Sustainable Resource Management:</h2>
        <p>Explores the principles and practices of sustainable resource management, including recycling, renewable
            energy adoption, and responsible land use.<br><br>Emphasizes the need to balance resource extraction with
            conservation efforts to ensure long-term sustainability.</p>
        <h2>Policy and Governance:</h2>
        <p>Discusses the role of governments, industries, and communities in effective resource
            management.<br><br>Highlights the importance of policies that promote conservation, sustainable practices,
            and innovation in resource management.</p>
        <h2>Technological Innovations:</h2>
        <p>Examines the role of technology in resource management, including efficient extraction methods, waste
            reduction, and the development of renewable energy technologies.<br><br>Discusses the potential of
            technological advancements to mitigate resource depletion and minimize environmental impacts.</p>
        <h2>Public Awareness and Engagement:</h2>
        <p>Emphasizes the importance of educating the public about resource management and encouraging individual
            actions. <br><br>
            Discusses the role of responsible consumption, waste reduction, and support for conservation efforts in
            creating a more sustainable society.</p>
    <section class="review">
        <p>This report highlights the challenges associated with managing Earth's finite resources and provides insights
            into sustainable resource management practices. By understanding the consequences of overexploitation,
            addressing resource distribution disparities, and fostering collaboration, we can navigate these challenges
            and strive towards a more sustainable future.</p>
